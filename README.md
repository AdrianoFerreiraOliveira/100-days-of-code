<h1>100 Days of Code - Python Journey 🐍</h1> <p>This repository contains the progress of a 100-day journey to study Python, from the basics to more advanced topics. The goal is to learn and practice daily, developing solid programming skills in Python.</p> <h2>Objective 📌</h2> <p>The <strong>100 Days of Code</strong> project aims to develop Python skills through consistent practice. Every day, a new lesson or challenge will be tackled, covering a wide range of topics from basic programming to automation, data manipulation, web scraping, and machine learning.</p> <h2>Project Structure 📂</h2> <p>Each day is organized into numbered folders, representing the activities completed on that day:</p> <pre> 📂 100-days-of-code ├── 📁 Day 01 - Introduction to Python ├── 📁 Day 02 - Conditionals and Loops ├── 📁 Day 03 - Functions and Modularization ├── 📁 Day 04 - String Manipulation └── 📁 ... </pre> <h2>Technologies Used 🛠️</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Python 3.x</strong>: The primary programming language of this project.</li> <li><strong>Libraries</strong>: <ul> <li>pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, and more as the project progresses.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Daily Challenges 💡</h2> <p>Throughout the journey, various programming challenges will be faced to solidify the learning. These challenges will cover:</p> <ul> <li>Programming logic.</li> <li>Data manipulation with Python.</li> <li>Development of small scripts and automations.</li> <li>Introduction to APIs and web scraping.</li> <li>Basic machine learning.</li> </ul> <h2>How to Contribute 🤝</h2> <ol> <li>Fork this repository.</li> <li>Create a branch for your contribution: <code>git checkout -b my-contribution</code>.</li> <li>Commit your changes: <code>git commit -m 'Added improvements'</code>.</li> <li>Push to your branch: <code>git push origin my-contribution</code>.</li> <li>Open a pull request.</li> </ol> <h2>How to Run the Examples ⚙️</h2> <p>To run the Python scripts in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. To run a specific example:</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to the folder of the corresponding day.</li> <li>Run the desired script with the command:</li> </ol> <pre><code>python script_name.py</code></pre> <p>If needed, install the dependencies using <code>pip</code>:</p> <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre> <h2>100-Day Journey 💪</h2> <p>This journey is not only about code, but also about consistency, discipline, and steady progress. Every small step counts, and over the course of 100 days, great achievements will be made!</p> <h2>Contact 📬</h2> <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me on GitHub or open an issue.</p>
