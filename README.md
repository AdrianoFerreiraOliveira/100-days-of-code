100 Days of Code - Python Journey 🐍
This repository contains the progress of a 100-day journey to study Python, from the basics to more advanced topics. The goal is to learn and practice daily, developing solid programming skills in Python.

Objective 📌
The 100 Days of Code project aims to develop Python skills through consistent practice. Every day, a new lesson or challenge will be tackled, covering a wide range of topics from basic programming to automation, data manipulation, web scraping, and machine learning.

Project Structure 📂
Each day is organized into numbered folders, representing the activities completed on that day:

📂 100-days-of-code
 ├── 📁 Day 01 - Introduction to Python
 ├── 📁 Day 02 - Conditionals and Loops
 ├── 📁 Day 03 - Functions and Modularization
 ├── 📁 Day 04 - String Manipulation
 └── 📁 ...


Each folder includes:

A specific README.md file explaining the concepts covered on that day.
Python scripts used during exercises and challenges.
Technologies Used 🛠️
Python 3.x: The primary programming language of this project.
Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, and more as the project progresses.
Daily Challenges 💡
Throughout the journey, various programming challenges will be faced to solidify the learning. These challenges will cover:

Programming logic.
+ Data manipulation with Python.
+ Development of small scripts and automations.
+ Introduction to APIs and web scraping.
+ Basic machine learning.
